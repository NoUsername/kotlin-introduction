* Null Safety
* Fully interoperable with Java
* Functional programming friendly
* Smart compiler

---

# Functional style

# More Code

---

# Try it

* It may look unfamiliar or hard to read at first
* Probably less so if you had exposure to Typescript, Swift, Rust, ...
* Find something to try it - even just your tests
* 2 Months until AOC ;)

---

# Word of advice

* Give non-null values a chance
* Give immutability a chance
* As always: use a formatter (like ktfmt)
* Even "Java-Style" + nonNull + immutable is already a big win

---

# Word of caution

* When starting to use it, don't go overboard with language features
* Find a common style
* Great power, great responsibility. You know the drill
